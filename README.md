## **Problem**

Millions of readers around the world spend countless hours consuming books, yet existing reading platforms offer no meaningful recognition, incentives, or sense of progress.  
Engagement is largely passive, leading many users to abandon reading habits despite strong initial interest.

At the same time, authors and publishers face major challenges:

- **Limited control over digital distribution**
- **Slow and inefficient payout systems**
- **Difficulty building active and loyal reader communities**
- **Minimal protection for digital ownership and rights**

The industry lacks a system that rewards readers for their effort and fairly empowers authors with modern, transparent distribution tools.
